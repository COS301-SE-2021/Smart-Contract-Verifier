## Smart-Contract-Verifier


### Project Description:
This project is to create a system that uses DeFi technology to enforce contracts.
Users will be able to set up contracts between each other, this includes an escrow service for payments.
If users disagree over whether a contract was fulfilled, a jury appointed by the system will make the final decision.
